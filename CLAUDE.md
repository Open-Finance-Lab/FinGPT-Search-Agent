When planning,writing or editing code, always follow these principles:

1. **Planning First**: Before implementing, verify or devise a clear plan and validate its reasonableness.
2. **Simplicity**: Actively seek simpler, more elegant solutions that avoid over-engineering during both planning and implementation.
3. **Core Principles**:
    - KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
    - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    - SOLID principles
4. **Step-by-step Validation**: After implementation, verify if the solution could be simpler while maintaining robustness and adhering to the above principles.

This approach should be applied to all code explanations, comments, and code changes to ensure maintainable, efficient, and clean communication and problem-solving.
