Code of Conduct
===============

Purpose
-------
The FinGPT Search Agent project is a collaborative research and engineering effort based at Columbia university and
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This Code of Conduct defines the expectations for everyone who contributes to,
tests, deploys, or otherwise interacts with the project so that we maintain a respectful, inclusive, and academically
ethical environment.

Scope
-----
This Code applies to all project spaces: Git repositories, issue trackers, chats, classrooms, labs, hackathons, conferences, and any in-person or online event where project members or partners interact. It supplements, and does not replace, university policies, Title IX obligations, state and federal law, and any sponsoring organization requirements.

Core Expectations
-----------------
- Treat every participant with respect, professionalism, and empathy.
- Welcome diverse perspectives; challenge ideas, not people.
- Credit collaborators, cite sources, and honor licensing obligations.
- Follow university research integrity standards, data governance rules, and IRB protocols where they apply.
- Protect confidential information, including user data, API secrets, and credentials.
- Communicate asynchronously with clarity, provide context, and respond promptly when tagged for blockers or review.

Unacceptable Behavior
---------------------
- Harassment, discrimination, bullying, or retaliation of any kind.
- Demeaning, inappropriately sexual, or exclusionary language or imagery.
- Intimidation, threats, or deliberate disruption of group work.
- Unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse of datasets, credentials, or devices.
- Plagiarism, falsification of results, or misrepresentation of authorship.
- Retaliation against anyone who reports a concern in good faith.

Reporting Concerns
------------------
If you experience or witness a violation:
- Contact the current project lead, Felix Tian, via Discord (fmk#2333) or via his school email tianf2@rpi.edu.
- For urgent safety issues, contact campus public safety or 911 before any internal report.
- You may also escalate to the university Office of Student Conduct, Equal Opportunity/Title IX office, or relevant faculty advisor.

When submitting a report, share what happened, when and where it occurred, who was involved, any witnesses, and supporting documentation (screenshots, logs) if you have them. Reports can be made anonymously by using campus reporting tools; anonymous reports will be reviewed to the extent possible.

Confidentiality & Privacy
-------------------------
We will protect the privacy of reporters and those involved, disclosing details only to individuals who need the information to investigate or resolve the concern. Mandatory reporting obligations under university policy and Title IX take precedence, and we will inform reporters when disclosures must be escalated.

Enforcement
-----------
The Project Lead, with support from faculty advisors or university offices, will review reports promptly and impartially. Possible actions include informal mediation, required training, reassignment of duties, suspension of repository access, or removal from the project. Severe or repeated misconduct may be escalated to university disciplinary processes or law enforcement as required.

Acknowledgment & Updates
------------------------
Participation in the FinGPT Search Agent project indicates agreement to abide by this Code. We review the Code annually (or sooner if policies or regulations change) to ensure alignment with university standards, federal and state law, and project needs. Suggestions for improvement are welcome; please submit them via the documentation issue tracker or directly to the Project Lead.
