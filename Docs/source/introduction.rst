Motivation
----------

Most of the current LLM-powered agents are general-purpose. They do not have a built-in knowledge base, meaning they cannot be personalized for users that don't possess strong coding skills. The few available agents that can parse a local knowledge base or have a built-in knowledge base are not popularized and far from the mainstream. FinGPT Agents aim to change this by providing a **user-friendly interface** with a **local** knowledge base that can be **easily customized**, and generate insights incorporating both **open-domain information** and **local information**. 

For students, imagine how much time may be saved from reviewing for an exam, if all you need to do is to copy all your notes into a local folder, and the agent will generate a tailored, personalized exam preparation plan for you, be it a crib sheet or a comprehensive study guide. For professionals, imagine how much time may be saved from reviewing a large number of documents, if all you need to do is to copy all your documents into a local folder, and the agent will generate a tailored, personalized report for you. 

*With FinGPT Agents, we aim to level up the general public's knowledge in finance, accounting, and business.*
